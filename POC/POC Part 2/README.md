### About POC Part 2
In part 2 of this course,  the programming portion of the class will focus on concepts such as recursion, assertions, and invariants. The mathematical portion of the class will focus on searching, sorting, and recursive data structures.  Upon completing this course, you will have a solid foundation in the principles of computation and programming.  This will prepare you for the next course in the specialization, which will begin to introduce a structured approach to developing and analyzing algorithms.  Developing such algorithmic thinking skills will be critical to writing large scale software and solving real world computational problems.
