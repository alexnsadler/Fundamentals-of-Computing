### About IIPC Part 1
In part 1 of this course, we will introduce the basic elements of programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) and then use these elements to create simple interactive applications such as a digital stopwatch.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game "Pong".
